# Forking

![](Screen Shot 2015-10-11 at 6.10.56 PM.png)

* 
Fork the hello world bot template at https://github.com/tpinecone/hello-world-bot/ 

* 
By forking the hello world bot template, you'll be able to keep your bot and the changes you make to it separate from the original template repo.

(Note: If you don't know what forking is do a google search. If you are still confused ask someone.)

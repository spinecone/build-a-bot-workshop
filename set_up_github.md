The template we're going to base a new bot on, Hello World Bot, is made up of 3 files. **book.txt** is where the text of a book will go. **bot.py** handles selecting chunks of text from the book and tweeting it. Finally, **secrets.py** will hold our authentication secrets which we'll cover in the next section. **secrets.py** is not included in the template repo since we don't want to make our authentication info publicly accessible.
